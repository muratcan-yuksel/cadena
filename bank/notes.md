## Variables

Solidity has local, state, and global variables. State variables are stored on the blockchain and `will cost gas`. Local variables are stored temporarily in memory and not saved. They're typically used in functions.

## Mappings

Mappings are like Objects in JavaScript, Dictionaries in Python, and Hashes in Ruby. They're always stored in storage, even if they're inside functions, because they're state variables. They aren't iterable but offer faster look up times than arrays.
